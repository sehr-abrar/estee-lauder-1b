## 🏗️ **Project Overview**

This project is part of the **Break Through Tech AI Program** in collaboration with **Estée Lauder** as our host company.

**Objective:** Evaluate the causal effect of surprise gifts on customer purchasing behavior and provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing gift strategies in marketing campaigns.

**Real-world Significance:** Understanding the true impact of promotional gifts on customer spending helps companies allocate marketing budgets more effectively, enhance customer experiences, and build long-term loyalty. This project demonstrates how causal inference techniques combined with machine learning can provide robust estimates of treatment effects beyond traditional A/B testing approaches.

## 📊 **Data Exploration**

### Datasets
- **experiment_results_1b.parquet**: Contains experimental data including treatment assignments, customer spending, and relevant features
- **pre_experiment_data.parquet**: Pre-experiment customer data used for baseline analysis and covariate selection

### Data Exploration Process
- Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on both pre-experiment and experiment data
- Analyzed customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and treatment group distributions
- Identified key covariates and potential confounders for treatment effect estimation

### Key Insights
- [To be filled based on EDA findings]

### Notebooks
- `EDA_pre_experiment.ipynb` — Analysis of pre-experiment data
- `EDA_experiment.ipynb` — Analysis of experiment results
- `power_analysis.ipynb` — Statistical power calculations for experimental design

## 🧠 **Model Development**

### Approach
- **Causal Inference Framework**: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) design
- **Treatment Effect Estimation**: Machine Learning Regression-Adjusted Treatment Effect (MLRATE)
- **Standard ATE**: Traditional Average Treatment Effect estimation for comparison

### Methodology
- Implemented MLRATE to improve precision of treatment effect estimates by adjusting for covariates
- Compared standard ATE with ML-adjusted estimates to demonstrate efficiency gains
- Conducted power analysis to determine sample size requirements and detect meaningful effects

### Notebooks
- `estimating_standard_ATE.ipynb` — Standard treatment effect estimation
- `estimating_standard_ATE_Updated.ipynb` — Updated analysis incorporating refinements
- `power_analysis.ipynb` — Power calculations and sample size determination

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### Potential Improvements
- Explore heterogeneous treatment effects across different customer segments (e.g., by purchase history, demographics)
- Implement additional machine learning models for treatment effect estimation (e.g., causal forests, meta-learners)
- Conduct sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of findings
- Develop a recommendation system for personalized gift strategies

### With More Resources
- Analyze longer-term effects on customer lifetime value and retention
- Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., website behavior, customer satisfaction surveys)
- Build a real-time decision system for gift allocation
